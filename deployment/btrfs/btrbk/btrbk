# Enable stream buffer. Adding a buffer between the sending and

# NOTE: If enabled, make sure the "mbuffer" package is installed on

# Directory in which the btrfs snapshots are created. Relative to

# If not set, the snapshots are created in <volume-directory>.

# If you want to set a custom name for the snapshot (and backups),
# use the "snapshot_name" option within the subvolume section.
#
# NOTE: btrbk does not autmatically create this directory, and the
# snapshot creation will fail if it is not present.

# Volume section: "volume <volume-directory>"
#
#   <volume-directory>  Directory of a btrfs volume (or subvolume)
#                       containing the subvolume to be backuped
#                       (usually the mount-point of a btrfs filesystem
#                       mounted with subvolid=5 option)
#
# Subvolume section: "subvolume <subvolume-name>
#
#   <subvolume-name>    Subvolume to be backuped, relative to
#                       <volume-directory> in volume section.
#
# Target section: "target <type> <volume-directory>"
#
#   <type>              Backup type, currently only "send-receive".
#   <volume-directory>  Directory of a btrfs volume (or subvolume)
#                       receiving the backups.
#
# NOTE: The parser does not care about indentation, this is only for
# human readability. The options always apply to the last section
# encountered, overriding the corresponding option of the upper
# section. This means that the global options must be set before any
# "volume" section.
